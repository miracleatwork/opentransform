Open Source version of Miracle Transform

Digital Transformation is a very challenging journey and many people have made it predictable by sharing their experiences on how they solved their challenges. We too belive in opensource and we are obliged by giving back to the wonderful community of Information Technology, with whom we have grown and made a difference to many businesses.

Open transform is an opensource project which automates conversion of monolith Java applications to Microservice based Application Architecture. Anyone can use it as first step towards Digital Transformation by realizing Hybrid Application Architecture.

It is not a complete solution for Digital Transformation. While this involves an Umbrella of Solutions like Containerizations, CI/CD/CR, Reactive Architecture and Application etc, we focus on smooth transition from Monolith to Hybrid architecture with automation and quick realization. For now we support only Java based application and Microprofile based Rest Applications within Hybrid Architecture, but we look forward to create an Umbrella of projects for complete Digital Transformation Journey.

The Primary benefits of opentransform are as follows:

	Create custom class definition to transform local function calls within the Class.
	Introduce Proxy Interfaces, which are capable of calling external services.
	Expose existing class methods by adding a REST Endpoint / Controller.
	Transform Local Function calls within Monolith, into a REST call.
	Easily save 20% efforts given for Manual code changes per service.
